# pyProxy

A simple, programmatic HTTP proxy written in Python.

pyProxy was created to facilitate scenarios where one might need to intercept
HTTP traffic. It allows for programmatic control of HTTP traffic, allowing for
the supression, modification or forwarding of HTTP requests and responses as
they transit through pyProxy.
